It was a surprise because I didn't know tree-climbing competitions existed, and I didn't know my brother climbed. When he won, he gave a short speech and thanked me and my sister for inspiring him to do what he loved - turns out she didn't know about the competition either. Afterwards we all went for cake to celebrate, and it was nice to realize not only how much I loved my siblings, but how much we loved each other.",

When I take walks alone I find myself awed by the flowers and buildings and sounds of the world in a way that I forget to when I’m with others. When I take a walk with a friend, I find myself more focused on the conversations we are having, and the thoughts in my mind. I think both are valuable and the experiences balance eachother out. The calm serenity of observing fills me with a deep fulfillment and tranquility.",
