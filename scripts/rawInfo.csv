I love you, even though sometimes I trip because I’m distracted by your presence and these feelings... of love… which I’d never felt before.

My heart almost burst, I couldn’t believe how magical it was hearing all of those instruments working together to create such brilliant sounds. Thanks for listening to me talk about things I love!","Hey, I wrote you a song! It’s inspired by the resonant frequencies of your laughter.

I’d really like to push the boundaries of what it means to be a rat. Can I be a bird? Can I be a plane? A hang glider? Whatever happened to the Hindenburg? Let me learn to fly and then I will know","I got so excited to see you today that I accidentally woke up early! again! I woke up at the perfect time though, because the early bird was in my yard! I said hello and asked about how they learned to fly so well. I thought birds knew how to fly as soon as they hatched, but apparently they don’t - they have an instinct and then they practice until they can do it. Just like me!","When I wake up and face my morning routine, one of the first things i do is stretttch!!!! Hands in the air! I stretch them up and down to lengthen them, which helps to not impede the flying process, and makes me more aerodynamic!!!","When I woke up today, I was so excited to see you.

I studied amongst the finest in my field and truly got in touch with my personal, professional, and artistic motivations","When I was abroad, my ice cream artistry class had a large focus on a strong conceptual backing, rather than just focusing on creating a technically perfect cone. With this, the nuance of choice entered my mind - a focus on the why not the how.","I graduated at the top of my class with honors of the highest caliber. More important to me than my academic standing was my self fulfilment in certifiably having mastered my craft. However, my pursuit is lifelong and I know I will continue to learn and perfect /past/ mastery.","One of my favorite moments was drizzling chocolate ganache on a pistachio-pastiche waffle cone, and presenting it to an undercover michelin star reviewer. As soon as they took the first bite, they thanked me and everyone started clapping. I was so overcome I started to openly weep.","As a savant in my field, and a former child prodigy, I have had the comfort of a deeply felt connection to my practice.

If other nobles see that I have many horses, they would not dare conspire against me because they will know that I am the most noble of all... due to the fullness of my stables and the freshness of my hay.

My teeth are brushed and I’m always up to date on my vaccinations and I change my bike’s oil every week just in case. I also keep at least $100 on me at all times.,A new person joined my underground bowling league the other day and they said they were friends with Jagadoo but I just called Jagadoo and they didn’t know who I was talking about. I’m wondering if the feds are onto us??? I really need to get to the store and switch out the bowling balls but honestly right now you’re my number one priority.,I went to my friend’s shop this morning and got you these keys for the Rambo 3000 MIX Dragon Fire all-wheel frontal axis gold plated Hammercycle © Motorcycle. They haven’t even gone on the public market but I wanted you to be able to take it for a test ride; I’ll take the back seat - how does a drive on the riverside sound?,Wow. You are so good at picking a rat to spend the rest of your life with. Let’s run away. Let’s elope. Let’s break the world record for most in love tandem motorcyclists. Whoops! We already did ;),,swalorn-plate.png,swalorn-oilmoney.png,,swalorn-keys.png,,,,,
t,tambone,Tambone,0.244,0.222,small,intense,Pisces,"Betrayal cuts deep,
The pain is like a knife,
I feel so alone.
Goodbye, traitor.
I am leaving this show.","You and me, could it be?","So I took my car to the mechanic and they said I needed an oil change, which got me thinking that maybe perhaps I am in more need of change in my life than I realized","Last week I turned the lights off and I was stunned by the darkness, so I wrote a poem titled “Dimly is the Moonlit Eve” … it ends “though the dawn is drawing near, moonlight knows what happened here”","Why do I write poetry? Hah! I might as well ask, why does the wind blow? Why does the moon control the tides, and why does a microwave pop my popcorn? It’s simply nature","On my walk today a gentle butterfly landed on a delicate flower. Its wings fluttered so gently and as it landed, two new beings touched for the first time and became one. It got me thinking about how I just met you but I already feel so connected to you. How is that possible?","I only have one Rattoo, it’s of an inchworm. I feel similar to an inchworm in many ways, though I never knew what I was inching towards. Now I know I’ve been inching towards you!","Your soul and my soul are threads in the fabric of a treasured garment, a favorite t-shirt from a memorable concert where a young love was formed. I’ve never met anyone like you before. You are home to me my dear, and I love you.",,,tambone-poem.png,,,,,,,
t,thundercroft,Thundercroft,0.333,0.126,medium-large,romantic_sad,Cancer,"Calm skies... sunny skies.... that's what I have to tell myself when I'm about to cry. I don't think it is healthy for me to stay with someone so mean, so I'm going to leave the show. Thanks for the good times.",Oh! I’m blushing,"Oh! Hello, I didn’t see you there. I was distracted by the weather! Those are cumulus clouds, some of my favorites! How about you?",I’m so glad we got to have a second date! I have to take a quick trip out to Ratvaria this evening. They’re having… some weather related problems I need to solve… we can talk about that later - how are doing today? Not too sunny I hope? And no above average windchill? Just let me know,"I’m glad we get along so well. People usually take a while to warm up to me. I have snake relatives on my mother’s mother’s aunt side, so I’m sometimes cold-blooded, but only literally! Not emotionally. But I can be shy, and I think sometimes people get the wrong impression, or they think my name is too scary.","When I was a kid I used to make the sky storm by accident. It would happen when I saw things that made me mad, like when I saw schoolyard Bob stealing lollipops from the other kids, or when I saw the effects of employers underpaying their workers. I want to leave the world a better place every day through small actions and sometimes I think about manipulating traffic lights a little bit just to optimize the flow but a small voice inside me says that would be wrong so I don’t","One time I bought some cotton candy, but I dropped it on the floor and started crying. When I started crying, it started raining and that made my cotton candy disappear and I started crying even more, and then the rain came down even harder, so then I was all wet and It made me even more sad. Which.. Well, lets just say that was the biggest flood my parents ever saw in Ratvada. It was good though ‘cause we were in the middle of a drought. That was the first time I started to really understand the power that individuals have to make the world a better place","Yesterday when I woke up for the sunrise - the perfect amount of mist was in the air so when the sun finally peaked over the hills, you could see all the colors and rays of light and… and I felt so warm and comfortable and inspired and I realized that’s also how I feel when I’m around you. I love you.",,,,,,,,,,
t,yodine,Yodine,0.322,0.144,medium-small,romantic_happy,Taurus,"I'm very upset by your words but at least i have my ring.. Honestly, I think this ring is all I ever needed. I'm going to leave this show.",Oh hello there! I’m Yodine,"I was so nervous to be a contestant that I went out and ended up buying myself my very own diamond ring. I thought this way I wouldn’t be as nervous about whether or not we get married, and I felt like it would take a lot of the pressure off, helping me feel more relaxed and authentic, instead of feeling like I’m in a competition with everyone.","I try to stay grounded but I think that sometimes other people’s expectations of me cloud my judgement and confuse my inner compass. That’s the last thing I want. I want to be able to know more about myself, and my thoughts and feelings - without other people’s getting in the way. That being said, I am grateful for my friends and my family and have a lot of love for the people in my life","When I was a kid my older sister brought me to the tree-climbing competition to watch my younger brother climb a tree as fast as he could. It was a surprise because I didn't know tree-climbing competitions existed, and I didn't know my brother climbed. When he won, he gave a short speech and thanked me and my sister for inspiring him to do what he loved - turns out she didn't know about the competition either. Afterwards we all went for cake to celebrate, and it was nice to realize not only how much I loved my siblings, but how much we loved each other.","I love my family and my friends, but I also appreciate time alone. I think it helps me to ground myself and interact with the world in a less distracted, more intentional way. When I take walks alone I find myself awed by the flowers and buildings and sounds of the world in a way that I forget to when I’m with others. When I take a walk with a friend, I find myself more focused on the conversations we are having, and the thoughts in my mind. I think both are valuable and the experiences balance eachother out. The calm serenity of observing fills me with a deep fulfillment and tranquility.","You know, I’ve grown quite fond of my ring. I think I wouldn’t mind wearing two of them! In fact I think I would actually quite prefer it! I’d even like to get you one.. If you would like? Then we would match :)  I think you are very kind and I wouldn’t mind spending the rest of my life with you - actually I think I might like that more than anything.","I’m so glad we found eachother. I think we are quite a pair. I’ve really loved getting to know you. I was really nervous about being here but your presence really calmed me, and I think we complement one another very well.",,,,,,,,,,
t,zindello,Zindello,0.444,0.104,medium-small,romantic_happy,Pisces,"This is a sign we were not meant to be. I hate to close doors, but I think this one must close. Goodbye, friend. Hope to see you around.",What is your sign?,"It’s a joy to look into your eyes, where I can see the twinkling sparkle of words that haven’t been said. I can’t wait to hear you say them!","Sometimes I draw a Tarat card in the morning to give me inspiration for the day, and this morning my card was all about creating new relationships. It made me think about you, and how excited I am to get to know you better.","I printed the stars from the skies from our birthdays and re-organized them so that the different constellations spelled out how much I love you -- 100,023! That was no accident, no serendipitous twist of fate, but the fruits of my labors.","What if we took a boat ride right now! That would be so romantic. I know it’s -10 degrees outside but I have 12 entire rain ponchos and some extra blankets so we will stay so warm. I think If we go all the way into the middle of the lake we would have such a lovely view of the moon, and then when the moon leaves we will be able to see the sun.","When I was walking home today I ran into a lizard who wouldn’t stop telling me the answers to different riddles, but wouldn’t provide the questions. Suddenly they said your name. I knew then and there the only question could have been: “Who is the rat nearest and dearest to your heart?”","My love, you are my past, my present, and my future! We are truly partners, and I am so delighted that you and I can explore all the wonders of this brilliant world together. Let’s go gaze at the stars and hold hands!",,,,,,,,,,
