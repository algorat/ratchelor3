Thundercroft,3,"I’m glad we get along so well. People usually take a while to warm up to me. I have snake relatives on my mother’s mother’s aunt side, so I’m sometimes cold-blooded, but only literally! Not emotionally.

When I started crying, it started raining and that made my cotton candy disappear and I started crying even more, and then the rain came down even harder, so then I was all wet and It made me even more sad. Which.. Well, lets just say that was the biggest flood my parents ever saw in Ratvada. It was good though ‘cause we were in the middle of a drought. That was the first time I started to really understand the power that individuals have to make the world a better place",,,,,,,,heart,pink,,,,heart,,,pink,,,,,,confused2,,wow,,,,,,confused2,,,,cry,cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flyboi,3,"I got so excited to see you today that I accidentally woke up early! again! I woke up at the perfect time though, because the early bird was in my yard! I said hello and asked about how they learned to fly so well. I thought birds knew how to fly as soon as they hatched, but apparently they don’t, they just have an instinct and then they practice until they can do it. Just like me!",,,,,blush,,,,,,,,,,,big_smile,,,,big_smile,,wow,,,wow,,,,,,,,,cry,,,,,,,cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yodine,1,"I was so nervous to be a contestant, that I went and bought myself a diamond ring.

When he won, he gave a short speech and thanked me and my sister for inspiring him to do what he loved - turns out she didn't know about the competition either. Afterwards we all went for cake to celebrate, and it was nice to realize not only how much I loved my siblings, but how much we loved each other.",,,,,big_smile,,,,big_smile,big_smile,,,,,,,,,,,,,,neutral,,,neutral,,,,,,,,tear,,cry,,tear,,cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I take walks by myself I find myself awed by the flowers and buildings and sounds of the world in a way that I forget to when I’m in company. When I take a walk with a friend, I find myself more focused on the conversations we are having, and the thoughts in my mind. I think both are valuable but experiences balance eachother out, and the calm serenity of observing fills me with a deep fulfillment and tranquility",big_smile,,,,,,,,,,,big_smile,,,big_smile,big_smile,,,,,,,sad,,,neutral,neutral,,,,,,,tear,,,,tear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
